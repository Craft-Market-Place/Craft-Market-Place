In the productHandler.test.js test, we have tested the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions of the productService through the productHandler handler. These functions include:

addProduct: which adds a new product to the system.
loadProducts: which returns a list of all existing products in the system.
loadProduct: which returns a specific product given its ID.
updateProduct: which updates an existing product in the system.
deleteProduct: which deletes a product from the system given its ID.
To run the test, the following command should be executed on the command line: npm run test.

npm run test
