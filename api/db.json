      "description": "A bright blue dress splattered by warm raindrops. My handmade pinafore dresses are available in four colours, this is the Royal Blue version which I've added orange and pink raindrops and blue glitter ones too spread around the lower dress. It also has a lined bodice, orange piping round arm and neck and a feature orange zip at the back. The raindrops are added individually so each dress will have a slightly different soaking of raindrops. I've used a medium weight cotton twill so it's nice and strong. Machine washable up to 40 degrees, if you use things called 'irons', you will have to do so on the reverse side of dress.",
